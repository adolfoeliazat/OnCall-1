Film Plant Off Shift Coverage readme file

This program calculates which employees are on call for each day and night shift during the year. 

1. Click on OnCall.jar

2. Answer the question: Has a new calendar year begun since the report was last used? In other words, have employees gone to new crews in January? If so, select yes and proceed to 3 and 4. If the answer is no, the program will continue immediately to step 5. 

3. If the answer to the previous question was yes, the program will request the date of A Crew's first full crew rotation in January. For example, if A Crew's first day back is January 5th, select 5. If it is January 2nd, select 2. It is VERY IMPORTANT that this number be correct. If it is not, none of the information in the report will be correct. 
NOTE: if A crew is in the middle of a rotation on January 1st, select the NEXT first shift date. Also, the program is concerned with full rotations. In other words, if the crews officially change  on January 7th, but January 5th was the first day of A Crew's full rotation, select 5, not 7. 

4. The program will next ask if A Crew's first full rotation is a day shift or a night shift. Select 1 for day shift or 2 for night shift. 

5. Type the operators for each crew into the text boxes, with the most senior operator in the first box and least senior in the last, based on Senior Extruder, Junior Extruder, and Pelletizer.

6. Click on the Record Names button. The program now has a record of the current crew line up. 

7. Click Run Report. A text file will appear in the Oncall folder next to readme.txt. Open it. 

8. Check the first entries for each crew to make sure the correct employees are on call. Once the first entry for each crew and classification is correct, the program will rotate the employees on call and properly schedule senior, junior, and pelletizer operators on call based on which crew is working on days and which crew is working nights. For this reason, it is better to run the program for longer periods of time, such as 4 months or the whole year, than shorter periods of time.
